      <h1>How to play color-linez</h1>
    
      <p>Start by clicking on an empty box to add colored circles. </p>

      <p>Click on a colored circle and then on a blank square to add more circles.</p>
    
      <p>Once you have have most of the boxes filled with colored dots, you can move them one space at a time to make your lines of five.</p>

      <p>Don't wait too long because new colored circles may continue to populate the board while you're trying to move yours into a line.</p>

      <p>The goal is to make a row of at least five of the same color.</p>
    
      <p>You can move other circles out of the way by moving them one spot to make space for the matching color.</p>
      
      <p>Once you have made a row of (at least) five, those circles will disappear from the board and you will get a point for each colored circle in the line. </p>
      
      <p>Happy playing!</p>
